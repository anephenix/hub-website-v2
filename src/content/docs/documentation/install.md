You can install Hub via [NPM](https://npmjs.com):

```shell
npm i @anephenix/hub
```

You will want to do this for both the project where you run the server, as well as for any other projects where you want the client to run as well (such as the frontend for a website or as a server-side client script).

## Can you run Hub on Deno or Bun?

Good question. We haven't tried that, so worth giving it a try and seeing if it works.
